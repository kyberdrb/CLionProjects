// C++: Polymorphic cloning and the CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern): CRTP with Multi-Level Inheritance: https://katyscode.wordpress.com/2013/08/22/c-polymorphic-cloning-and-the-crtp-curiously-recurring-template-pattern/

//This solution is all very well if you have:
//- no constructors
//- only default constructors
//- all constructors in all derived classes use the same signature
//- the individual derived classes only use constructors which donâ€™t call any base constructors
//Most of the time though in a real world application, the derived classes will have multiple constructors with different signatures, and oftentimes you will want to call a base constructor too. In these cases, you will experience the constructor forwarding problem.
