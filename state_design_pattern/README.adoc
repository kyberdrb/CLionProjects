# State Design Pattern

## Further development

Implement production-ready State design pattern to another directory under another namespace according to below-mentioned hints:

```
// TODO further development - tasks postponed in order to keep accuracy with the original state machine diagram on refactoring.guru site
        // State Design Pattern - Variations:
        // TODO v3: Precreate all states and save them to 'vector<State>'/'hashmap<StateEnum, State>' and then change references at transitions instead of creating new instance at each transition

        // State Design Pattern - SRP applications:
        // TODO v4.1: encapsulate 'std::cout' calls into 'Terminal' singleton class
        // TODO v4.2: encapsulate 'std::stringstream' calls into 'Message' class
        // TODO v4.3: make 'StateFactory' class as a (static) Factory method
```
